# why need docker ?
```
Developing apps today requires so much more than writing code. Multiple languages, frameworks, architectures, and discontinuous interfaces between tools for each lifecycle stage creates enormous complexity. Docker simplifies and accelerates your workflow, while giving developers the freedom to innovate with their choice of tools, application stacks, and deployment environments for each project.
```
# why is this project ?
```
Cause I have enough experience in docker\docker-compose\docker-swarm and willing to share my experience, I hope that you can try to learn and use it in production environment
```
# Abount this project
* docker &amp; docker-compose &amp; docker-swarm
